    <h1>ALL BOUT YOU!</h1>
      <p>Adulthood is overrated. A great many people utter this statement out of frustration, and it's not 
        surprising. Being an adult sometimes comes with overwhelming responsibilities. There are targets to 
        meet at work, and there is a lot of work to do at home. When you factor in social activities and other 
        engagements, you will relish the opportunity to trade places with that baby who has nothing to worry 
        about. But we all know that's next to impossible. The only way to be at peace with yourself is by 
        embracing the numerous responsibilities and taking some time to focus on what is essential. This 
        includes self-care.</p>
    <h2>WHAT IS SELF CARE?</h2>
      <P>What is self-care? Self-care is a general term that describes everything you do deliberately for 
        your mental, physical, and emotional well-being. As simple as it sounds, many of us pay little attention 
        to self-care. This is why ‘deliberately' is one of the most important words in the definition. You need 
        to be conscious of your well-being before you can achieve true self-care. It starts from the simple acts 
        like not checking emails at night when you know it affects your sleep and extends to more important 
        decisions like going for a vacation or booking a massage when you feel you need one.</P>
    <h2>LOVE YOUR LIFE</h2>
      <p>Self-Care is personal, and no general principle will always work. What motivates you and inspires you 
        is different than the person next door. Look for the things that make you feel alive. Make dates with 
        yourself and when you commit to working out or doing something for yourself, keep the commitment you make 
        to yourself. We don't back out on our friends, don't back out on yourself. By being healthy about self-care, 
        you will feel be better equipped to help others. Go live your best life.</p>
    
    <h2>TIPS FOR SELF-CARE</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li><strong>Pay attention to your physical and mental health</strong></li>
    	<p>Physical health is a core part of self-care. The body and the mind have a unique connection, and 
        it's difficult to be in high spirits when you are not feeling good about your body. Research has 
        shown that regular exercise increases the level of serotonin in our body significantly improving 
        mood and energy. When exercising for self-care, you should choose an activity you love. It could 
        be a regular run, brisk walking, swimming, or just about any other thing that makes you feel alive. 
        You derive extra fulfillment from doing what you love, and it is the love that encourages persistence 
        even when it seems you do not have time for it.</p>
    	<li><strong>Get sound sleep</strong></li>
    	<p>Too many people are sleep deprived, and it takes a toll on our physical and mental health. We seem 
        to have made the maxim ‘hard work pays' too seriously. We now spend so much time working and very 
        little time sleeping. Sleep scientists recommend that adults need at least 6-8 hours of sleep every 
        night. Your body needs time to rest and renew. Daytime naps are also excellent for refreshing our 
        body and improving concentration levels.</p>
    	<li><strong>Be a healthy eater</strong></li>
    	<p>Your diet is a major part of self-care, and it's an aspect you should be wary about. When you ask 
        people about foods that make them feel good, you get answers like a juicy steak, mounds of lasagna, 
        or extremely delicious cupcakes. However, consistently indulging in these delicacies is NOT self-care. 
        Healthy, nutritious foods are one of nature's best gifts to us. Make a habit out of consuming good 
        foods that build your body.</p>
    	<li><strong>Change your mindset / Gratitude</strong></li>
    	<p>Too often, we focus on the negatives while showing little appreciation for the beauty that's all 
        around us. It's what happens when you have a bad breakup, and all you can remember is how badly 
        the person hurt you. We tend to forget all the amazing things that the relationship brought us. 
        Cherish the good memories and hold them dear even if the unpleasant ones attempt to consume you. 
        Show gratitude and appreciation for the little gifts in life. Take take time to be still and 
        meditate more. If you can adopt a gratitude mindset, you are on your way to achieving the highest 
        level of self-care.</p>
    	<li><strong>Learn to say No</strong></li>
    	<p>Too many times, you say yes to every request in order to not hurt the feelings of another party. 
        When you do this at the expense of your own peace or health, you are going against the principles 
        of self-care. It's good to realize you're only human and you can't possibly make everyone happy. 
        Saying yes to everything predisposes you to burnouts, and it's bad for your physical and emotional 
        health.</p>
